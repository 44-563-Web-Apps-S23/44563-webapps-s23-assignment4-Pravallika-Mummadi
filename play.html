<h6 class="ROSA">ROSA.</h6> <p class="speech">Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
too. I'm sure it's a trick!</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Looking out toward the back._]</p> <p class="speech">Dear, dear, isn't that
Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
does he always want up here?</p>

<h6 class="ROSA">ROSA.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Pointedly._]</p> <p class="speech">He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
here all day.</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="speech">That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
way to manage it!</p>
    <p class="direction"> [STRÜBEL _enters.</p> <p class="speech">He is a handsome young fellow without much
     polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
     invariably good-natured._</p>
<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="speech">Good day, everybody.</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU .</h6> <p class="direction">[_Sarcastically._]</p> <p class="speech">Charming day.</p>

<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Surprised at her coolness._]</p>  <p class="speech">I say! What's up? Who's been
rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. <p class="direction">[_Sits
down._]</p> Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>
<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="direction">[_After a pause._]</p>  <p class="speech">H'm, H'm.</p>

<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="speech">Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="speech">In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know
that my name is Frau Lindemann.</p>

<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="speech">Just so.</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="speech">And, secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity----</p>

<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Singing, as_ ROSA _brings him a glass of beer_.]</p>
<p class="speech">"Beer--beer!"--Heavens and earth, how hot it is!</p> <p class="direction">[_Drinks._</p>

<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="speech">If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down
there at the Springs?</p>

<h6 class="STRÜB">STRÜB.</h6> <p class="speech">Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights--my soul thirsts for the
heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has
thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."</p>
<h6 class="FRAU">FRAU.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Scornfully._]</p> <p class="speech">Bah!</p>
