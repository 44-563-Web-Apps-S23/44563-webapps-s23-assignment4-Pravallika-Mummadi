Scribner's Sons, the publishers of _Roses_, from which this play is
taken. For permission to perform address the publishers.</p>

<p>ROSA. Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
too. I'm sure it's a trick!</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Looking out toward the back._] Dear, dear, isn't that
Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
does he always want up here?</p>

<p>ROSA. [_Pointedly._] He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
here all day.</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
way to manage it!</p>

    <p> [STRÜBEL _enters. He is a handsome young fellow without much
     polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
     invariably good-natured._</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. Good day, everybody.</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Sarcastically._] Charming day.</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. [_Surprised at her coolness._] I say! What's up? Who's been
rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [_Sits
down._] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_After a pause._] H'm, H'm.</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know
that my name is Frau Lindemann.</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. Just so.</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. And, secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity----</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. [_Singing, as_ ROSA _brings him a glass of beer_.]
"Beer--beer!"--Heavens and earth, how hot it is! [_Drinks._</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down
there at the Springs?</p>

<p>STRÜBEL. Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights--my soul thirsts for the
heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has
thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."</p>

<p>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Scornfully._] Bah!</p>
